2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` file

## 📋 Table Structure

The `bookings` table includes:

### Customer Information
- `customer_name` - Customer's full name
- `customer_email` - Email address
- `customer_phone` - Phone number with country code

### Trip Details
- `pickup_location` - Pickup address
- `destination` - Destination address
- `pickup_date` - Date of pickup
- `pickup_time` - Time of pickup

### Vehicle Information
- `vehicle_type` - Selected vehicle (GMC Yukon, Toyota Camry, etc.)
- `vehicle_image` - Image URL of the vehicle
- `passengers` - Number of passengers
- `luggage` - Number of luggage items

### Booking Management
- `status` - Booking status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- `confirmation_token` - Unique token for email confirmation
- `confirmed_at` - Timestamp when booking was confirmed
- `special_requests` - Any special requests from customer
- `total_price` - Total price for the trip

### Timestamps
- `created_at` - When booking was created
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## 🔒 Security (Row Level Security)

The schema includes RLS policies:

1. **Service Role Access**: Full access for server-side operations
2. **Anonymous Insert**: Anyone can create bookings (needed for public booking form)

---

## 🔍 Indexes

Optimized indexes for fast queries:
- Email lookups
- Status filtering
- Date range queries
- Confirmation token lookups
- Recent bookings (created_at DESC)

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Could not find the table 'public.bookings'"
**Solution**: Run the `supabase-schema.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor

### Error: "permission denied for table bookings"
**Solution**: Check that RLS policies are created correctly. Re-run the schema script.

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution**: This is normal - it means the table already exists. You can safely ignore this or drop the table first:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bookings CASCADE;
```
Then re-run the schema.
